Objectives:
- join the tables to find the total seconds between logins and logouts
- answer "how much damage did each player take in total"
- what was the average damage taken per death
- what player died the most/least
- what time of day do players die the most (lol not really something anyone would ask)

- also for more advanced stuff you'll want to know retention. So if you assume that instead of deaths those are sessions/logins, you can sort of work out retention data and create retention funnels

- also if you pretend that instead of "last login" it's "first_login" (the first table) you can then make more sense since some of those sample players would have to play many days on end without logging out otherwise
