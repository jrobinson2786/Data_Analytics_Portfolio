##Player Churn, Retention, & Segmentation

I thought this would be a fun project and it falls within a domain of interest. Full disclosure: I don't quite know how to do a segmentation analysis, but I managed to piece something together through articles and various other resources.  

I start with a player churn analysis, which indicates the percentage of players that have stopped player the game within the given timeframe. 

Then I conduct a player retention analysis which presents the number of player still engaged as well as a percentage of the total within the given timeframe. 

Finally, for the segmentation, calculated each player's completion percentage and grouped the players into segments based on the percentage of levels that they completed in 25% increments. This allowed me to analyze the average tendencies of each group (ie: help used, retry times, success time, etc.)

One important insight that I've discovered while researching segmentation is that the project is ever-evolving and that the metrics and segment of the initial version is refined over time through conversations with teammates and stakeholders once the needs and objectives become more clear.
