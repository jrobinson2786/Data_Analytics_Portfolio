Player Churn, Retention, & Segmentation

I thought this would be a fun project and it falls within a domain of interest. Full disclosure: I don't quite know how to do a segmentation analysis, but I managed to piece something together through articles and various other resources. 

The purpose of a segmentation analysis is to group customers, or players in this case, in order to gain insights toward defining characteristics.   

One important insight that I've discovered while researching segmentation is that the project is ever-evolving and that the metrics and segment of the initial version is refined over time through conversations with teammates and stakeholders once the needs and objectives become more clear.
